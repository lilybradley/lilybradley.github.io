<pre><code>How I learned to code: A work in progress
</code></pre>

          <p>
            Step 1: Complete <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/web">Codecademy's HTML & CSS course</a>. 20-40 hours
          </p>
            Step 2: Study websites' HTML & CSS by 1) Enable developer tools in your web browser. On Safari (Mac), go to Preferences (command + ",") > Advanced > click "Show Develop menu in menu bar". Now it appears on the menu between "Bookmarks" and "Window". <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-z_apOmTWRY">YouTube instructional video</a>. 2. Visit websites you like, and click "Show Web Inspector" from the developer menu. 2-4 hours.
          </p>
          <p>
            Step 3: Create a website. Blogs are popular personal websites. WordPress provides free and paid templates and is supposed to be easy to use. I got stuck trying to connect it with my domain name and the domain name server and other nonesense. Very frustrating; not at all covered by the Codecademy course; and not relevant to learning to code. I ended up finding github pages easiest to set up with the caveat being that I happily accepted the .github.io url (to not deal with aforementioned hassle).
          </p>
          <p>
            Step 4: GitHub. Sigh. They make you learn a lot of technical jargon upfront. When I have time I will create a cheat sheet. A few important ones: A "git" is "save as" - but more flexible to allow for multiple editors/versions. A "pull request" is a "please use this version". A "commit" is "I accepted your changes and saved". I like GitHub because it provides ample opportunity for imitation (highest form of flattery, right?). Just make sure you "cite your source" - give credit, read the copyright and licensing information. Note that stuff developed by the US government by nature is in the public domain and therefore is not copyrightable. Set up your GitHub page by following <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/creating-pages-with-the-automatic-generator">these directions</a>.
