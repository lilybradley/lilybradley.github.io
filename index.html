          <h2>How I learned to code: A work in progress</h3>

          <p>
            Step 1: Complete <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/web">Codecademy's HTML & CSS course</a>. 20-40 hours
          </p>
            Step 2: Study websites' HTML & CSS by: 1) Enabling developer tools in your web browser. On Safari (Mac), go to Preferences (command + ",") > Advanced > click "Show Develop menu in menu bar". Now it appears on the menu between "Bookmarks" and "Window". 2. Visiting websites you like, and click "Show Web Inspector" from the developer menu. 2-4 hours.
          </p>
          <p>
            Step 3: Try to create a website. Blogs are popular personal websites. WordPress provides free and paid templates and is supposed to be easy to use. I got stuck trying to connect it with my domain name and the domain name server and other nonesense. Very frustrating; not at all covered by the Codecademy course; and not relevant to learning to code. I ended up finding github pages easiest to set up with the caveat being that I happily accepted the .github.io url (to not deal with aforementioned hassle). 2-200 hrs.
          </p>
          <p>
            Step 4: Check out GitHub. 10-20 hrs.
            <ul>
              <li>
                Sigh. They make you learn a lot of technical jargon upfront. When I have time I will create a cheat sheet. A few important ones: 
                <ul>
                  <li>"git" is "save as" - but more flexible to allow for multiple editors/versions</li>
                  <li>"pull request" is a "please use this version with my changes"</li>
                  <li>"commit" is "I accepted your changes and saved"</li>
                  <li>"clone" is "download an offline version"</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                I like GitHub because it provides ample opportunity for imitation (highest form of flattery, right?). Just make sure you "cite your source" - give credit, read the copyright and licensing information. Note that stuff developed by the US government by nature is in the public domain and therefore is not copyrightable. 
              </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            Step 5. Set up GitHub. 
            <ul>
              <li>
                Sign up for an account.
              </li>
              <li>
                Set up your GitHub page by following <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/creating-pages-with-the-automatic-generator">these directions</a>.
              </li>
              <li>
                Download GitHub Desktop. For <a href="http://mac.github.com">Mac</a>. Did you set up your own GitHub page yet? If so, "clone" (i.e., download an offline version) to your desktop.
              </li>
              <li>
                Turn your text editor into an HTML editor: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-z_apOmTWRY">YouTube instructional video for Mac</a>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            Step 6. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Work in progress...
